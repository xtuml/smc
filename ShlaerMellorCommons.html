<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shlaer-Mellor practitioners from all parts are converging and
organizing into a community of practice.  This document explores
requirements for governance of the <em>Shlaer-Mellor Commons</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-introduction-and-background">2 Introduction and Background</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Shlaer-Mellor community ('the community') emerged late in
the previous century and was largely governed within the
commercial world of service providers, trainers and
license-based tool vendors. The community was fragmented,
regionalized and sometimes internally competitive. As the
software and systems engineering worlds have embraced open
source software (OSS) and worldwide collaborative and
distributed development, the influence of the commercial vendors
has waned. Even so, the method has continued to succeed in teams
on various continents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The availability of OSS tooling has increased during the last 10
years. And a sequence of technical conferences focusing on the
practice of Shlaer-Mellor modeling has been a catalyst to the
convergence of the various practitioners and service providers.
There is a groundswell within the community to collaborate and
promote the application of Shlaer-Mellor modeling within the
engineering development world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The time is right to formalize the relationships within the
community under a clear governance of the <em>Shlaer-Mellor
Commons</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-requirements">3 Requirements</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="3-1-mission">3.1 Mission</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Shlaer-Mellor Commons exists to foster a community of
collaboration, camaraderie and advocacy around the method,
models and tooling.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="3-2-common-property">3.2 Common Property</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The community is steward to the Shlaer-Mellor Commons. This
commons is centered around tangible and intangible common
property shared within the community and accessible to the
world. The common property includes but is not limited to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the Shlaer-Mellor Method as documented in books, reports and
as implemented in various tooling repositories of open source
software (OSS) and documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>model editors, compilers and runtime environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>repositories of models: application domains, examples, tests</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="3-3-roles-and-leadership">3.3 Roles and Leadership</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teams within the community provide focus on specialized aspects
of Shlaer-Mellor activities.  The community has been recruited
and the Commons initiated by a Community Steward.  The team structure is
initially fluid, however a structure is emerging.  Three teams
provide focus on the methodology (OOA Team), tooling (RD team)
and the community itself (Community Team).  Each team has a
leader/facilitator and is organized within itself.</p>

<h2 id="4-vision">4 Vision</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As stated above, the Shlaer-Mellor Commons exists to foster a community of
collaboration, camaraderie and advocacy around the method, models and
tooling.  The vision for the future involves increasing the effectiveness
of the <strong>collaboration</strong>, <strong>camaraderie</strong> and <strong>advocacy</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="4-1-collaboration">4.1 Collaboration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key goal is to find and connect Shlaer-Mellor modelers from all corners.
The Commons community will be the easiest, most efficient and enjoyable
means of collaborating with fellow modelers.  Existing and new practitoners
will find the people they need and the tools to work together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When people search for 'Shlaer-Mellor', 'xUML/xtUML', 'executable
modeling' or 'modeling and translation', they will find the Shlaer-Mellor
Commons.  They will find colleagues.  They will find tools to engage with
these colleagues efficiently and pleasantly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the Commons is largely an Open Source Software collaboration, users
will find all of the tools and ways of working expected for open source
projects.  They will find issue trackers, source code repositories and
commmunication channels that are best present practices in the online
engineering development world.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="4-2-camaraderie">4.2 Camaraderie</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shlaer-Mellor Commons members are a distinct group with distinct
interests.  Shlaer-Mellor people share some ways of thinking and enjoy
sharing time with others who value precise modeling, execution and
translation.  People will find opportunities to enjoy time together
through online communications channels, work opportunities, conferences,
training materials and articles of interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conferences and physical gatherings will be arranged and promoted through
the Commons communication channels giving members the opportunity to enjoy
working and relaxing together.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="4-3-advocacy">4.3 Advocacy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Shlaer-Mellor Commons promotes a particular process of systems
analysis and design, because it is seen to be effective and even a Better
Way in many situations.  Therefore, practitioners desire to see the
community grow and see the Method applied more widely.  Members of the
Shlaer-Mellor Commons promote involvement and growth.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="4-4-visionary-crystal-ball">4.4 Visionary Crystal Ball</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, with the above stated, what might this look like?</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>coalescence of the various Shlaer-Mellor related groups (PT, KC, MI/R,
xtUML, xUML, OOA, etc.) linked from the more general Shlaer-Mellor Commons</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="5-roadmap">5 Roadmap</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The roadmap is simply the realization of the vision.  With a roadmap, the
vision can be "project managed" into reality a step at a time.  While it
is nice to have a grand vision, it is also wise to be realistic in terms
of involvement in voluntary activities like the Commons.  Therefore, with
a vision, a roadmap and modest expectations, the Shlaer-Mellor community
can celebrate incremental steps along the roadmap.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="6-participation">6 Participation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Shlaer-Mellor Commons is composed of shared property as outlined
above.  This property is largely Open Source Software (OSS) and
documentation.  Thus, material participation is accomplished in the "Open
Source Way".  The Commons attempts to utilize best practices established
by other successful communities and bodies of shared IP.  Projects such as
Linux, Apache and WordPress have sustainably engaged users, developers and
advocates over the years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Central to open source projects are the following:  issue tracking, source
code management and communication channels.  Participation in the
community means connecting through the currently established issue
trackers, source code repositories and communication channels.  Thus, the
first step for any participant is to mechanically connect to these three
fundamental elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mechanics of this participation infrastructure will start with
available resources and grow and improve over time according to the
Roadmap.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="6-1-issue-tracking">6.1 Issue Tracking</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Successful open source projects track issues.  An issue can be a question,
bug report or feature request.  What is critical is that issues are
captured, identified and progressed through a lifecycle.  This will look
like engineering development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#dr-3">[dr-3]</a> is a link to the initial issue tracker being used by the
Shlaer-Mellor Commons.  To use the tracker, it is necessary to register a
user ID.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="6-2-source-management">6.2 Source Management</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source projects maintain repositories of source code and
documentation in version control systems.  These repositories enable
changes and additions to be made to the body of knowledge incrementally,
methodically and safely.  Changes in the source body are linked to
issues in the issue tracker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Shlaer-Mellor Commons manages a composition of source code
repositories associated with the various sources of tooling and
documentation.  Google Docs and git repositories will be common for the
foreseeable future.  Other collaboration environments are likely to be
added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Active and successful participants will become comfortable collaborating
on shared documents which are version controlled.  Participants involved
in source code (models and tooling) will become comfortable forking,
branching, merging and submitting pull requests to these various source
repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#dr-4">[dr-4]</a> is a link to the xtuml source repositories on GitHub.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="6-3-communication-channels">6.3 Communication Channels</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication is the foundation of community.  The Shlaer-Mellor Commons
is an online community and uses internet-based communication channels
such as email, chat rooms and social media.  Successful participants will
join the various channels.  These channels and their appropriate use is
constantly evolving along with rest of the internet culture.  The Linux
community started in a Usenet newsgroup and has migrated and adapted as
different media became available and popularized.  The S-M Commons will do
the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="6-4-participant-howto">6.4 Participant HOWTO</h3>
<div class="olist arabic">

<p>On 2 of the 3 issues at hand, I believe the PT position also captures the
initial OOA as regards event prioritization and polymorphic events (OOA
96).  WRT association formalization, I would need to research a bit
further.  My sense is that the original OOA assumed that associations were
formalized as a matter of course.  I doubt I will find the word
'mandatory' or 'optional', but I will look.  All known tooling required
formalization perhaps for a variety of non-Method issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WRT event polymorphism, we do have a syntactic and semantic divergence
that I am keen to learn the origins of and discuss the recommendations
going forward.  Colin has suggested a fairly practical Way Forward, and I
will probably agree.  However, I will enjoy learning:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1) How did we manage to get these 2 different interpretations?
2) Is one of the interpretations more correct?  (true to what Stephen and Sally had in mind)
3) Is one of the interpretations better?  (more powerful and generally useful)</p>
